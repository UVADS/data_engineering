    "# Part 1 Downloading and running the basic jupyter notebook image.\n",
    "## Docker is conveniently set up to look for predetermined images in dockerhub, and install it if it is not already insatlled.   This makes first runs easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The source for our lab images will be docker hub.  Here is a link to the first image we'll use, a jupyter server with scipy pre-installed: https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/scipy-notebook\n",
    "2. Go to that site, and look around.  Look at the `Tag` tab, docker images are versioned just like code.  So you can also specify a specific build of a docker image.\n",
    "3. Note how the name of the image is `jupyter/scipy-notebook`.  We'll be using this name in the next step to let docker know we want to wake up an instance of this image.\n",
    "4. To start the process we'll run the following command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker run -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down\n",
    "* `run` is dockers command to start a server, if an image is not found, one is downloaded.  Which will be our case on first use\n",
    "* `-d` is the flag to run the notebook in the background.  This will free up the command line, so you can for example, start another server.\n",
    "* `-p 8888:8888`, -p is the flag for a port mapping.  The numbers that follow are `<local machine port>:<docker port>`.  Jupyter's default port when the docker image wakes up is 8888.  So what we are saying here, is that the jupyter server which would be found usually on port 8888 will be mapped to our machine on port 8888.  To make this clearer, say we typed `-p 8899:8888` instead.  When the docker image wakes up, we would go to our browser to `http://0.0.0.0:8899` and internally, dockers port will be accessed as if a browser inside the docker instance was using `http://0.0.0.0:8888`\n",
    "* `jupyter/scipy-notebook` is the name of the image we are requesting from docker hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidentally, how do we know the default port is 8888?  The obvious answer is the documentation: https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html .   As stated in class, some ports are set by convention, but it is always better to check, in our case, jupyter is not always defaulted to 8888.\n"
