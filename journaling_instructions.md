### Journaling Instructions

The purpose of this exercise is to track your learning and growth through this course.
You will add an entry for each Module (ideally on a weekly basis). 
You will submit your journal over the course of the term, and it will grow with your new entries.

Each entry should answer these questions:
- What were some things you learned in the module?
- What do you think were the most important concepts?
- What was challenging for you? How can you learn it better?
- Which parts did you enjoy?

Each entry should:
- Use full sentences to show good writing and clear thought process
- Be limited to one or two paragraphs (it should be fairly brief)

File format: Use a Word doc or similar. Recycle the same file throughout the course.
Action Item: Write a journal entry for this Module. It will be submitted later.
