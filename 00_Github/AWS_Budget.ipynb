    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use free-tier in first half of course, and move to suggested ideal size, t2.large.  Then we can get a lower/upper on a range corresponding to 10/20 hours per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roughly 150 USD to 300 USD for all students\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pros\n",
    "* Directly interacting with AWS hands on\n",
    "* Uniformity across all student environments, saving time trouble-shooting installs\n",
    "* No leftovers on student's machines after course (this was mentioned in the comments)\n",
    "* If we set up SSH keys, assistance can be done pair programming remotely (tmux setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cons\n",
    "* If someone inadvertedly leaves a machine running that could cost roughly an additional 2.50 USD a day, (18 USD week), **PER** student\n",
    "* Additional course time dedicated to setting up AWS EC2 instance and SSH.  However, this is also listed as a Pro in the list above... it is after all a valuable real world skill to have\n",
    "* I thought this would help with automated grading, but it actually doesn't, a preferred method would still be to pull an update on a student's git repository and run that through tests\n",
